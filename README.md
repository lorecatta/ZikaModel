# stochastic-zika-model
This repository contains the R package for running the Zika transmission model developed at Imperial College London using R odin.

The transmission model is a stochastic metapopulation model which include the dynamics of the _Aedes_ mosquito vector and the human host populations. The model simulates also the impact of control strategies such as the releae of Wolbachia-infected mosquiotes and vaccination.

For details of the original transmission model please see the [Ferguson et al. 2016 paper](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/353/6297/353) 
which is the article where the model is published.
