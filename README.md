`ZikaModel` is an R package for running the Zika transmission model
developed at Imperial College London using R odin.

The transmission model is a metapopulation model which includes the
dynamics of the *Aedes aegypti* mosquito vector and the age-stratified
human host populations. The model which has a stochastic and a
deterministic version, simulates also the effect of seasonality and the
impact of control strategies, such as the release of Wolbachia-infected
mosquitoes and child vaccination.

For details of the original transmission model please see the original
[article](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/353/6297/353) where the
model is published.

## Installation

You need to first install the [odin](https://github.com/mrc-ide/odin) R
package.

Once odin is installed, you can install the `ZikaModel` package with the
following steps:

-   First install `devtools`, if you donâ€™t already have it

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
```

-   Then, in a fresh R session, install the `ZikaModel` package

``` r
devtools::install_github("lorecatta/ZikaModel")
```

-   Load and attach it

``` r
library(ZikaModel)
```

## Running the base model

Check out this vignette on how to run the
[deterministic](https://lorecatta.github.io/ZikaModel/articles/deterministic_base.html)
base version of the model.
